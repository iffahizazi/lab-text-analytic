I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.

However, Samsung still has not fixed the issue with screen burn-in. So, I can't use apps like TikTok or Instagram for too long, as the screen easily burns in, and you start seeing ghost images on the screen. This issue is related to all OLED and AMOLED displays.

The phone is superb,  this is the pinnacle of the ultra S series, the display,  ease of use,  customization, chipset, 7 year software and security updates, etc etc.Idk what the haters are talking negative about this phone.There's very little to complaint about this phone, specially after the big software update from 2/22. Only thing I wish it had is an IR blaster and if it had come with free buds
